## üõ†Ô∏è Our Projects

### Astrological Market Intelligence System

A modular, open-source framework designed for cryptocurrency market analysis through astrological patterns. It combines advanced AI algorithms with astronomical data to identify potential market trends. The system leverages deep learning models for celestial pattern forecasting, incorporating quantum-inspired signal processing and cross-chain planetary correlations. Our framework features comprehensive time-series astro-momentum indicators, adaptive position sizing, and neural network-powered aspect weight optimization. It integrates moon phase volatility modeling with multi-dimensional planetary cycle analysis, while providing automated chart pattern recognition with zodiac correlations. The system includes real-time celestial event impact scoring, supported by a decentralized astrological consensus mechanism and universal time calibration for global market alignment.
